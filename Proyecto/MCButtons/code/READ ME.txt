In order to use this code you must set up your button.
On the code.txt file you will find the base for your button and you will see some values that you must change.
----------------
1)name="serverButton", change the name of your button to whatever you want

2) class="yourclasshere", this needs to be changed if you modified the class name on the CSS style sheet

3)id="serverButton", change this to whatever you want

4)value="Our Server", this is the text that will be displayed in your button, so change it if you want

Thank you, a lot, for downloading this code :)
