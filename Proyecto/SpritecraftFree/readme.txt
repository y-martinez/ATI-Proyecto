===================  RUN SPRITECRAFT  ===================
For most users, you can run Spritecraft simply by double-clicking on the .jar file (either SpritecraftFree.jar or SpritecraftFull.jar). You will need Java for this to work, but since Minecraft runs on Java it is likely you already have it installed.


===================  TROUBLESHOOTING  ===================
If double-clicking on the jar file fails, try one of the following:

- BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, verify that you have at least Java 7 installed (you can do this at a command prompt by typing "java -version"). The vast majority of problems running Spritecraft are because the user doesn't have Java 7. You can get it from www.java.com.

- If you are on windows, double-click either RunSpritecraftFree.bat or RunSpritecraftFull.bat (this must be in the same directory as the .jar file)

- If you are not on windows, use the command prompt to change to the spritecraft directory, and do the following:
  - For the free version, type this:
    java -jar -Xmx1024m SpritecraftFree.jar
  - For the full version, type this:
    java -jar -Xmx1024m SpritecraftFull.jar
